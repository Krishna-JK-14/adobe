If necessary, select either the  Hand Tool  or the  Select Tool  from the context menu of the page (right-click on the page to open the context menu). The pointer changes to a different icon as you move it over a field. For example, the  Hand tool changes to an I-beam  when you can type text into the form field. Some text fields are dynamic, meaning that they automatically resize to accommodate the amount of data you enter and can span across pages. 2. Select anywhere in the form to access options, such as radio buttons. Select inside a text field to type. Press Tab to move forward or Shift+Tab to move backward. 3. When finished, submit the form to either send the data to a server or create an email to send the data."
